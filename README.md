# Python_pomodoro_app

A Pomodoro timer is a timer that allows the user to work in blocks of a number of minutes(usually 30 minutes) separated by breaks.
The design will be a pure html+css app written in django or flask
It should allow the user to set singular blocks of time, longer blocks of time with changeable intervals ( for example 2x 30 minute work, 2x 10 minutes of rest intervals and then 4 * 40 minutes work / 10 minutes rest intervals)
It should offer labelling and creating daily and weekly reports
